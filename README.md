# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

I like to travel so I was motivated to design a website where I can see the weather forecast for the present date as well as the next 5 days. I built this project to see which day would be most suitable for me to travel to my destination. This helps me in preventing having to check my phone or open multiple apps whereas I can check whichever city I so choose. This convenient weather app helps me plan ahead of time in case of any undesirable weather conditions. I learned how to use APIs to fetch real time data for web development purposes.

## Installation

Download an IDE. 
Use OpenWeatherMapAPI to fetch desired APIs.
 
## Usage

Type a city of your choice in the search bar. The API will then fetch real-time data to provide you the temperature, wind speed, and humidity of desired city.
